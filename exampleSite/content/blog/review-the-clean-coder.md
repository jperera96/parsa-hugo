If you are here just wondering whether you should buy the book or not; just buy it. The book is really good and it will provide you with lots of wisdom. No matter whether you are a trainee, a junior, or the most experienced developer in the office. The book may have its flaws but, overall, it's undeniable that reading it is well-invested time and money.

The book features no code at all. Its subtitle “A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers” doesn’t lie. The book is basically a compendium of common sense attitudes, advice, and personal experiences from its author, Robert C. Martin (AKA Uncle Bob).

Therefore, any junior developer will greatly benefit from reading experiences and mistakes made by an older fellow developer. Thus, a more experienced developer may feel like the content of this book is too basic for their needs. And… I must say that probably yes. Nevertheless, the book is pretty short and easy to read. I read it in just two afternoons. So, solidifying presumably already acquired professional conduct will do no harm to anyone and good to you, your boss, and your workmates.

Most of the chapters start by stating the author’s “wrong” attitude towards a problem and how he got into trouble because of that. Then he explains how by using the “correct” conduct he fixed the issue or didn’t get into that situation in the first place. Most of the examples are really old, before 1990 and it can feel like you are reading your grandpa's war stories. But, most of them can still be applied nowadays because remember, it’s just attitudes! It’s not talking about the latest JavaScript framework. I must say, that the age of the book makes it feel like our department, call it IT, R&D or whatever, is seen as very unprofessional. I’m sure this was the case 30 years ago but nowadays, where every company is a tech company, I don’t think that’s the case anymore.

If I were to criticize its content, I would say that the chapter that talks about dealing with pressure, the eleventh one, is the only chapter that I found a little bit vague. In my opinion, it doesn’t provide any actual advice or relevant experiences. Also, take into account that the book is not precisely brand-new. Thus, making the tooling section is extremely outdated. I wouldn’t even bother reading it.

However, more than problems with its content, which is pretty brilliant, my biggest criticism would come from what’s not in the book. The book assumes that you will be dealing with professional and reasonable people. Fortunately, most of the time that’s true but at some point, everyone will have to deal with not so reasonable people. I was also missing a chapter on how to leave a toxic workplace like the aforementioned without burning too many bridges. Well, there isn’t a single word on how to switch jobs, and, nowadays, I believe this can be useful for a lot of developers. The book briefly mentions that any good programmer should mentor junior developers. And I definitely agree. Nevertheless, it doesn’t mention how to deal with those juniors. Something that is not so straightforward.

Criticism that I’ve seen over the Internet and I don’t agree with is that the book feels dogmatic and its English is not so easy to read. In my opinion, this comes from the haters of the author’s well-known “Clean Code” book. I will agree with that criticism for the first book. But, not for the one we are reviewing right now. Most of the examples are pure common sense. You can even argue some things are objective. Except for the TDD chapter, I don’t think this book feels dogmatic at all.
